    old "One of the most renown among France's 45.000 châteaux, the history of this estate is as fragmented as its current configuration is bizarre. It started as a vanity project from a member of pre-revolutionary aristocracy, in a bid to emulate the pomp of King Louis the XIV's Palace of Versailles. Unfortunately, the French Revolution would put an end to the project and the September Massacres would put an end to his lineage."

    old "The never completed project was left to rot for more than a century, becoming the center of numerous urban legends and fanciful stories, like being a hideout for the resistence during World War II. It was eventually acquired by the eccentric Abelard Du Bois in the mid 1950s, who would over the course of two decades turn it into the château as it is today. A lover of history and foreign architecture, he turned each building of the estate into a showcase for one of his passions."
