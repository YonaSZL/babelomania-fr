    text _("""In spite of gaining its name only in the 20th century, this form of traditional Japanese verbal comedy has been around for almost 400 years. It finds its origins in storytellers who would settle in Japanese cities and give performances right in their homes, entertaining the public with various humorous tales for a fee. Its modern form, however, did not emerge until much later, when such performances executed in posh restaurants led to an immense rise in popularity, eventually resulting in the creation of entire theaters dedicated exclusively to Rakugo.""") justify True
    text _("""Both the form and content of a Rakugoka’s repertoire are varied, ranging from concise anecdotes to more complex and lengthy tales with a variety of characters. Such stories are always told by a single person, usually on a theater stage in front of a live audience, which can draw parallels to the western style of stand-up comedy.""") justify True
    text _("""Each story culminates with a punchline called ‘Ochi’, aspect reflected in the very name of the genre which translates to ‘falling words’ or ‘a story with a fall.’ Over the centuries Rakugo has significantly influenced various other forms of performative art, although many of these offshoots tend to deviate from the strict structure that defines it.""") justify True
