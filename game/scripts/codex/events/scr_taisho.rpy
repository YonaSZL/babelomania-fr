    text _("""The Taishō Era of Japanese history is the period that goes from the 30th of July 1912 to the 25th of December 1926, coinciding with the reign of Yoshihito, 123rd Emperor of Japan.""")

    text _("""A short period due to the health problems of the Emperor, it is remembered as a transitionary period between the chaotic Meiji period and the more militaristic first part of the Showa era, which would see the country veer towards totalitarianism and ultranationalism.""")

    text _("""The Taishō era was characterized by political and intellectual fervor, also due to the influence of Western Culture which was exemplified in the architecture and fashion of the time. The period saw protests and fights for ideals like universal male suffrage, worker's rights and social welfare but also political repression of left-leaning movements and high profile assassinations, like that of Prime Minister Hara Takashi. Also notable was the Great Kantō Earthquake of 1923.""")
