    text _("""Although this esteemed brand of mineral water has its roots in France, it has gained significant traction in the Anglophone world. 
    Its history can be traced to the early 20th century, when a British entrepreneuracquired a small sparkling water spring in France, and 
    rebranded it in honor of its previous owner, Francois Berrier.\nHe then began exporting the bottled carbonated water under the Berrier name 
    back to his homeland, riding a fashion trend for all things French which quickly elevated its popularity among the British middle and upper 
    classes.

    text _("""In a remarkably short period, Berrier's status changed from mere bottled drink to something of a status symbol: marketed as 'the 
    Champagne of mineral waters', it was eventually granted the Royal Warrant, making Berrier the official supplier of bottled water for Buckingham 
    Palace.\nWhile Berrier's popularity has waned somewhat waned over the years, following several restructuring efforts and scandals-this product 
    remains one of the most globally recognized premium mineral water brands, with billions of bottles sold worldwide.
